<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In contemporary software development, the operational dynamics of microservices are widely acknowledged. The notion of discrete executables is indeed captivating, yet realizing this abstraction often entails significant costs, whether temporal or financial, particularly for small to mid-sized projects and organizations.

This template facilitates the consolidation of separate modules into a single executable, while ensuring that this amalgamation remains true to the essence of modularity. The modular design is not merely theoretical; rather, it encompasses entirely autonomous modules that can be effortlessly removed from the solution by eliminating a single line of code, without engendering any semantic or logical inconsistencies.

By adopting this template, you will:

- Attain a coherent and multi-modular code structure.
- Embrace an Onion architecture within each module.
- Enjoy support for multiple database types.
- Practice the SOLID principles in a programmatic context.
- Conduct both unit and integration tests.

This project aims to simplify complex development concepts and make them accessible to everyone. Feel free to use it in your own projects and see the benefits firsthand!
